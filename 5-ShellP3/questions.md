1. Your shell forks multiple child processes when executing piped commands. How does your implementation ensure that all child processes complete before the shell continues accepting user input? What would happen if you forgot to call waitpid() on all child processes?

The implementation ensures all child processes complete by calling waitpid() for each forked process in the parent which blocks the parent process until the child process exits. If waitpid() wasn't called, the parent might continue to accept user input or spawn new processes, leading to resource leaks since the operating system would retain information about the terminated child processes.

2. The dup2() function is used to redirect input and output file descriptors. Explain why it is necessary to close unused pipe ends after calling dup2(). What could go wrong if you leave pipes open?

Closing unused pipe ends is necessary to avoid resource leaks and prevent unintended interference with data flow. If pipe ends remain open, the system might misinterpret that the write end of a pipe is still active, and cause read operations to block forever. It also ensures proper cleanup of file descriptors to conserve system resources.

3. Your shell recognizes built-in commands (cd, exit, dragon). Unlike external commands, built-in commands do not require execvp(). Why is cd implemented as a built-in rather than an external command? What challenges would arise if cd were implemented as an external process?

The cd command modifies the current working directory of the shell process. If implemented as an external process, it would change the working directory of the child process only, and leave the parent shell's directory unchanged. Thus, it wouldn't actually traverse the directories.

4. Currently, your shell supports a fixed number of piped commands (CMD_MAX). How would you modify your implementation to allow an arbitrary number of piped commands while still handling memory allocation efficiently? What trade-offs would you need to consider?

To allow an arbitrary number of piped commands, I could dynamically allocate memory for the pipe file descriptors and command list as needed, using functions like malloc() and realloc(). This would allow the shell to grow the array of pipes and commands as the user adds more pipes. The trade-off would be managing memory efficiently, ensuring proper allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks, and the complexity of handling resizing during runtime.
